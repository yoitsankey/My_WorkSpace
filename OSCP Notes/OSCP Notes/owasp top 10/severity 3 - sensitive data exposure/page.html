<title>Severity 3 - Sensitive Data Exposure</title>
</head><body><ul><li>Webapp accidentally gives sensitive data that is often directly linked to customers (e.g. names, dates-of-birth, financial information, etc)</li>
<li>At more complex levels this often involves techniques such as a "Man in The Middle Attack" - Non encrypted or weakly encrypted data can be intercepted leading to sensitive data exposure</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<b>Sensitive Data Exposure (Supporting Material 1)</b><ul><li>Databases can be set up on dedicated servers, running a database service such as MySQL or MariaDB</li>
<li>But databases can also be stored as files and are referred as "flat-file" databases, as they are stored as a single file on the computer.</li>
<li>If a Flat-file database is stored in a folder that a user can access after connecting to a website (i.e., flat-file database is stored in root directory of the website) then that database file is exposed to the user and it means there is sensitive data exposure.</li>
<li>The most common format of flat-file database is an <b>sqlite</b>&nbsp;database and it can be queried using <b>sqlite3</b>&nbsp;program.</li>
</ul>
