<title>Severity 7 - Cross-site Scripting</title>
</head><body><b>Cross-site Scripting (XSS):-</b><ul><li>Injection which allows an attacker to execute malicious scripts on a victimâ€™s machine.</li>
<li>A web application is vulnerable to XSS if it uses unsanitized user input.</li>
<li>XSS is possible in Javascript, VBScript, Flash and CSS.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
There are three main types of cross-site scripting:<ul><li style="list-style-type: none">1. Stored XSS - Often happens when a website allows user input that is not sanitised when inserted into the database.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none">2. Reflected XSS - An attacker needs to trick a victim into clicking a URL to execute their malicious payload, the malicious payload is part of the victims request to the website. The website includes this payload in response back to the user. </li>
<li style="list-style-type: none">3. DOM-Based XSS - It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style and content.</li>
</ul>
