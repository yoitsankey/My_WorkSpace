<li>SUBNETTING</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>Number of bits that are turned on in a Subnet Mask is its called CIDR value.</li>
<li>Number of Hosts depends upon the number of bits turned off in a Subnet Mask.</li>
<li>The rule for turning on the bits in a subnet mask is consecutive from right to left.</li>
<li>CIDR stands for Class-less inter Domain Routing.</li>
<li>If a CIDR value is something let's say 24 then it can also be called as Whack 24 or /24 Network.</li>
<li>Number of hosts from a subnet mask also helps in determining the final broadcast id.</li>

<ul><li>The IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) &nbsp;has primarily been responsible for assigning address blocks to the five regional internet registries or RIRs.</li>
<li>Autonomous System (AS) Numbers are used by various routing protocols. IANA allocates ASN to Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) &nbsp;</li>
<li>The five RIRs are:</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>AFRINIC, which serves the continent of Africa</li>
<li>ARIN, which serves the United States, Canada and parts of the Caribbean</li>
<li>APNIC, which is responsible for most of Asia, Australia and New Zealand and Pacific Island nations</li>
<li>LACNIC, which covers Central and South America and any parts of the Caribbean not covered by ARIN</li>
<li>RIPE, which serves Europe, Russia,the Middle East, and portions of Central Asia</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none">- The RIRs further allocate or assign AS Numbers to network operators in line with RIR policies.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none">- These five RIRs have been responsible for assigning IP address blocks to organizations within their geographic areas.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"></li>
<li>Small organizations don't have dedicated CIDR Range.</li>
</ul>
